i will have files here that i need in other places
this is mainly a cdn for stuff

to make your own modpack installer, you only need to copy /minecraft/modpacks, modpacks.json and the naming scheme (both are linked. id-version.mrpack)  
(if only it actually worked)  
  
This is now used as a cdn or something idk: [cdn.tedps.tk](https://cdn.tedps.tk)
